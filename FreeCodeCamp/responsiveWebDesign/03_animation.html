<!--
To animate an element, you need to know about the animation properties and the @keyframes rule. 
The animation properties control how the animation should behave and the @keyframes rule controls what happens during that animation. 
There are eight animation properties in total. 

animation-name: sets the name of the animation, which is later used by @keyframes to tell CSS which rules go with which animations.
animation-duration: sets the length of time for the animation.
animation-fill-mode: if you want the ele remains the last state of @keyframes, you can set this to forwards.
animation-iteration-count: the repeat times of animation
animation-timing-function:

@keyframes is how to specify exactly what happens within the animation over the duration.
