Des: pass state from parent to child as props
A common pattern is to have a stateful component containing the state important to your app, that then renders child components. 
You want these components to have access to some pieces of that state, which are passed in as props.
you have an App component that renders a Navbar, among other components. 
In your App, you have state that contains a lot of user information, but the Navbar only needs access to the user's username so it can display it. 
You pass that piece of state to the Navbar component as a prop.
